# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is JavaScript Exchange. It is the 'language' where JavaScript and HTML work together to bring a functional user interface to the user. One syntax difference between HTML and JSX is the use of camel.Case when declaring attributes, etc. In HTML camel.Case is not used, where in Javascript, it is.

Researched answer: JSX is the syntax extension that allows markup and logic to be rendered in the same file. It gives React it's "elements". JSX can be aded to if statements, for loops and assigned to variables. To use the JSX, it needs to be wrapped in curly braces. 

The syntax difference is the use of camelCase which is used as a property naming convention. When using JSX, because it uses more Javascript, is used.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a package manager that JavaScript uses to hold previously made snippets of code that are pulled from a server on command. This allows the code that is written to run smoother and more efficiently, while not having to remember all of the commands to do that.

Researched answer: One of the main JavaScript package managers, it was developed by Meta(Facebook). It is popular with those who utilize React. It checks for package integrity, ensures it's speedy install. It is utilized on Node.js. You can install a single package or all packages.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A React component is a sepereate file within the main app that allows the coder to input other data/functions to keep it seperate from the main App.js. This is to provide efficiency with troubleshooting and deploying new functions to an app, without having to change the main branch of coding.

Researched answer: Component in React is a reusable and indepenedent bit of code. There are two types, a Function and Class. The Function type works similar to Javascript and returns HTML. A componenet will begin with a capital letter. They can be embedded in other componenets, in files and referred to as "props".

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are a value of the whole code and props (or properties) in React are similar to components, where a snippet of code is passed back to the main state.

Researched answer: State values are internal and stored within the componenet. Props are a value that is fixed and get passed to a componenent. 

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: Document Object Module is the interactable user interface that you see within an app/webpage. It is the user interface where you click on components or features of the app/webpage.

Researched answer: DOM is Document Object Model and is the API for HTML. It allows modification of an HTML document. It is a World Wide Web Consortium standard. It allows the coder to configure HTML elements by providing functions to add/modify/delete data or values. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: Div tags involve a class name where span tags do not.

Researched answer: A div tag is a block level element and a span tag is an inline element. Div is used for a bigger piece of text and span can be used for a smaller piece of text. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Also known as OOP, takes data and the function surrounding it and holds them together so that the only function that is able to access the data is the one that is designated. 

2. Ruby: An object-oriented, back-end programming language that is praised for it's simplicity and structure. It is the language that delivers what you see on the web browser from the server. It also has a strong, open source community that is active on resources and advice.

3. Implicit return: If no return exists after the value on the last line, the method is returned automatically. 

4. Ruby blocks: Code in a Block is wrapped within curly braces and is invoked froma function that is named the same as the block. A yield statement will invoke the block. 

5. Ruby hashes: A has is a colleciton of key-value pairs that are set in curly braces, seperated by commas. Hash can use any object type and have a default value that is returned if a key does not exist.
